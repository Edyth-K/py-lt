✅ What I did today:
- (previously) set up authentication with google api
- (previously) added some AI generated functions that interact with the doc
- append_text function that adds only to the end of the document
- automated daily devlog note generator

🔧 What I’m working on next:
- text-to-speech, then adding that text to the google doc

⚠️ Issues or blockers:
- Due to how the Google API uses the index of a document to insert content, it can lead to complications when simultaneously editing text manually and programmatically adding text. Currently using a "safe" solution of only appending to the end of the document, but haven't tested it in depth yet.

🧠 Notes / Thoughts:
- want to add:
    - piping TTS through AI to format grammar and try and catch intended sentences
    - creating new documents with specific headers and titles
    - integrate the whole thing into a web-app?
