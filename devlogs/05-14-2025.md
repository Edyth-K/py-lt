✅ What I did today:
- initial append_header function, which adds text to beginning of a google doc

🔧 What I’m working on next:
- need to modify it to have proper formatting, like bolding title
- speech-to-text and adding 

⚠️ Issues or blockers:
- need to figure out how to implement actual header formatting that is built-in to google docs 

🧠 Notes / Thoughts:
- want to add:
    - piping TTS through AI to format grammar and try and catch intended sentences
    - creating new documents with specific headers and titles
    - integrate the whole thing into a web-app?
- possibly integrate RealtimeSTT from https://github.com/KoljaB/RealtimeSTT ?
