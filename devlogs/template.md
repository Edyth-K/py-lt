✅ What I did today:
- Set up project structure
- Initialized Git and created repo
- Added first class: `DataParser` in `parser.py`
- Wrote simple test script for it

🔧 What I’m working on next:
- Improve parsing error handling
- Start working on data validation module

⚠️ Issues or blockers:
- Unsure whether to use `pydantic` or custom validation

🧠 Notes / Thoughts:
- Consider adding a command-line interface later
